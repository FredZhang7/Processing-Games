# My Grade 7 and 9 Learning With Processing #

#### Processing is SO FUN!!!
- Processing 3 provided so many __cool GUIs__ for beginner programmers, and the __syntax is easier to learn__ compared to Java!
- I coded a lot of mini games and fancy art drawings from just a few lines of code!

#### IMPORTANT
- Those projects are public, but please don't republish them!
