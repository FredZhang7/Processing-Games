# My Grade 7 Learning With Processing #

#### Description
- I took a programming class, and the teacher asked us to code a mini project each class, so here's everything that I learnt in Gr. 7

#### Processing is SO FUN!!!
- Processing 3 provided so many __cool GUIs__ for beginner programmers, and the __syntax is easier to learn__ compared to Java, too!
- You can also draw complex geometry shapes with just a few lines of code!
